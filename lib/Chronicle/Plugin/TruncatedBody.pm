=head1 NAME

Chronicle::Plugin::TruncatedBody - Support for Truncating longer blog posts.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The module allows you to truncate longer blog posts.

To use this you need to add C<__CUT__> within the post body to
the start of its own separate line.

=cut

=head1 METHODS

Now follows documentation on the available methods.

=cut

package Chronicle::Plugin::TruncatedBody;


use strict;
use warnings;

our $VERSION = "5.0.9";


=head2 on_insert

The C<on_insert> method is automatically invoked when a new blog post
must be inserted into the SQLite database, that might be because a post
is new, or because it has been updated.

The method is designed to return an updated blog-post structure,
after performing any massaging required.  If the method returns undef
then the post is not inserted.

If the new entry has a C<__CUT__> on its own line, the text before the
cut is marked as part of the truncated body and a link pointing the
reader to the rest of the article.

The body text is then cleaned by removing C<__CUT__>.

:B<NOTE> If there are multiple __CUT__'s within a file, only the first
correctly placed __CUT__ will be used.  Other __CUTS__ will be ignored
and will remain within the body and or in the truncated body in the case of a
incorrectly placed __CUT__ prior to a correctly placed __CUT__.
