=head1 NAME

Chronicle::Plugin::Archived - Generate dated-posts.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is disabled by default, but if it is enabled your generated
blog will contain links to dated posts.

For example by default a blog entry might be generated with a URL such
as C<http://example.com/my_first_post.html>.  With this module enabled
that will change to C<http://example.com/2015/09/my_first_post.html>.

B<NOTE> If you enable or disable this plugin you will need to regenerate
your SQLite database.

=head1 METHODS

Now follows documentation on the available methods.

=cut

package Chronicle::Plugin::Archived;

use strict;
use warnings;


our $VERSION = "5.0.9";


use Date::Format;
use Date::Parse;


=head2 on_insert

The C<on_insert> method is automatically invoked when a new blog post
must be inserted into the SQLite database, that might be because a post
is new, or because it has been updated.

The method is designed to return an updated blog-post structure,
after performing any massaging required.  If the method returns undef
then the post is not inserted.

In this method we rewrite the link of the pending-post such that it
is prefixed with the year and month - turning the link into a dated
one.

=cut

sub on_insert
{
    my ( $self, %args ) = (@_);

    my $dbh    = $args{dbh};
    my $config = $args{config};
    my $data   = $args{data};

    #
    #  Convert the date of the post to a seconds past epoch.
    #
    my $date = str2time( $data->{date} );

    #
    #  Now build up a new prefix for the file
    #
    $date = time2str( "%Y/%m/", $date );

    #
    #  And prepend that to the link.
    #
    $data->{link} = $date . $data->{link};

    return ($data);
}
