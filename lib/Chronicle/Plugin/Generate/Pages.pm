Now follows documentation on the available methods.

our $VERSION = "5.0.9";


=head2 on_generate

The C<on_generate> method is automatically invoked to generate output
pages.  This particular plugin method is invoked I<after> any
C<on_initiate> methods which might be present.

This method is responsible for generating each distinct blog-post for
your site, via the theme-template C<entry.tmpl>.

If pages have previously been generated, and exist on-disk already,
then we skip regenerating them unless either:

=over 8

=item The C<--force> flag was used.

=item The post was written within the past ten days, and comments are enabled.

=back

The latter point is designed to ensure that a rebuild will pick up
any recent comments added to your posts without manual attention.
