C<on_generate> methods which might be present.

This method updates the global variables, which are made available to
all loaded templates to define meta variables such as C<chronicle_version>
containing the current release number, and C<build_date> and C<build_time> containing the date and time of when the blog was (re)build (respectivley).

sub on_initiate
{
    my ( $self, %args ) = (@_);

    my $dbh    = $args{ 'dbh' };
    my $config = $args{ 'config' };



    #
    #  The chronicle version
    #
    $Chronicle::GLOBAL_TEMPLATE_VARS{ "chronicle_version" } =
      $Chronicle::VERSION;

    my $time = time ;
    #
    #  The chronicle build date
    #

    $Chronicle::GLOBAL_TEMPLATE_VARS{ "build_date" } =
      time2str( "%e %b %Y", $time );

    #
