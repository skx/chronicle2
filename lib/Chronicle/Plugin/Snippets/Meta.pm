use warnings;
use Date::Format;

our $VERSION = "5.0.6";


=head2 on_initiate

The C<on_initiate> method is automatically invoked just before any
C<on_generate> methods which might be present.

This method updates the global variables, which are made available to
all loaded templates to define meta variables such as C<chronicle_version>
containing the current release number, and C<build_date> and C<build_time> containing the date and time of when the blog was (re)build (respectivley).
